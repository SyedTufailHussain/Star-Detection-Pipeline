This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting stars from FITS images.

How to Use

1. Download the FITS Files

You need to download the required FITS files separately.

Place them inside the fits folder in this repository.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

The notebook already contains outputs and images.

If you want a fresh run, go to Kernel â†’ Restart & Clear Output and then Run All.

3. Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the code:

pip install astropy numpy matplotlib

4. Notes

4. Notes
The repository does not include FITS files due to size constraints. You need to add them manually in the fits folder.

A .gitignore file is included to exclude FITS files from being uploaded to GitHub, ensuring the repository remains clean and lightweight.

If the outputs and images are already present in the notebook, you can clear them before execution.


6. Contributing
